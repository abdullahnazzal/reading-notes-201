# Audio, Video, Images:

## Controlling sizes of images in CSS:

You can control the size of an
image using the `width` and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.

## Aligning images Using CSS:

We use `float` property can be used
to move an element to the left or
the right of its containing block.

## Centering images Using CSS:

By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel
element using the `display`
property with a value of block.

## Background Images:

The `background-image`
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element.

## Repeating Images:

The `background-repeat`
property can have four values:

- `repeat` The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically.

- `repeat-x` The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).

- `repeat-y` The image is repeated vertically only.

- `no-repeat` The image is only shown once.

- `fixed` The background image stays in
the same position on the page.

- `scroll` The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.
